# EasyBuild Examples

CCR staff utilize the Easybuild framework when installing software and this tool is made available to CCR users to install software themselves. Easybuild ensures that the compilation and linking that happens during a software installation is done correctly and will work with our systems. CCR staff do not offer courses on using Easybuild, nor are we able to troubleshoot issues you might run into. However, there is excellent [documentation](https://docs.easybuild.io/) and [tutorials](https://tutorial.easybuild.io/) provided by Easybuild developers.

This directory contains Easybuild examples for running on CCR's clusters.
